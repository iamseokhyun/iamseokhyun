Life is a journey, and we all need a little inspiration to keep us movin' and groovin'. That's why I believe that people are like a symphony - each unique but together create a powerful sound. I'm all about fueling that excitement by maximizing individual capabilities through advanced deep learning research.

Specially, I am interested in discovering and improving how large-scale language or multimodal models reason logically. My research focus is on proposing novel training/inference mechanisms that allow them to efficiently and bias-robustly retrieve and fuse meaningful information from large-scale data(both unimodal and multimodal).

Currently(and fortunately!), I am a research assistant at <em>Language & Intelligence Lab</em>, advised by [Prof. Hyounghun Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/language-intelligence-lab/home?authuser=0). 

Research Interests: LLM, NLP, Commonsense Reasoning, Multi-step reasoning
