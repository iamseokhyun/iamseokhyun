### Hi there üëãüèª 
# This is Seokhyun An.

I am an undergraduate student at [UNIST CSE](https://www.unist.ac.kr/, "unist link"). My goal is to make the world cool by maximizing people's potential and individuality through advanced Deep Learning research. Currently, I am working as a research intern at Intelligent Control and Reasoning Lab, advised by [Prof. Sungbin Lim](https://sites.google.com/view/sungbin/, "lab link"). If you want to know more about me, please refer to my [CV](https://iamseokhyun.github.io/CV/CV_SeokhyunAn.pdf, "lab link"). I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, so feel free to contact me!
