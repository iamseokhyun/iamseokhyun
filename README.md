People grow through people. We inspire each other with our unique individuality, originality, passion, and creativity. So our lives are unpredictable and fantastic. 

My goal is to fuel this virtuous circle through advanced deep learning research. I am interested in discovering and improving how large-scale language or multimodal models reason logically based on facts. My research goal is to propose novel training/inference mechanisms that allow them to efficiently and bias-robustly retrieve meaningful information from large-scale data. 
Currently, I am a research assistant at <em>Intelligent Control and Reasoning Lab</em>, advised by [Prof. Sungbin Lim](https://sites.google.com/view/sungbin/).

Research Interests: Deep Learning, NLP, Commonsense Reasoning, Embodied AI, Neural Combinatorial Optimization
